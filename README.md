# SapphireEngine
A game engine built on sdl2 and c++ 14. Designed to be game agnostic, but currently configured to run the earlier Nancy Drew games at https://github.com/16jalayt/PhantomDogs. This is the main driver for this project, however object creation is abstracted away. Can currently load simple scenes from ND #7 Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake (PC 2002). Assets not included.

The project is far from playable!
